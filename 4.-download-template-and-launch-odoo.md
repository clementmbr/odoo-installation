    src: https://github.com/oca/ocb 12.0 # The community core of Odoo SA

server-tools:
    src: https://github.com/OCA/server-tools 12.0

usability:
    # Modules in [] will be added to the 'odoo/links/' folder
    # and will be automatically available for installation.
    modules: [partner_tree_default, base_usability, product_usability]
    remotes:
        origin: https://github.com/akretion/odoo-usability
    merges:
        - origin 12.0

server-brand:
    modules: [disable_odoo_online, remove_odoo_enterprise]
    remotes:
        oca: https://github.com/OCA/server-brand
    merges:
            - oca 12.0
            - oca refs/pull/12/head # Specify a special PR you want to download
    # In case of multiple merges indicated, ak (via gitaggregate) will :
    # 1. fetch all the listed branches
    # 2. create a branch called 'merged' from the first one
    # 3. merge sucessively all the other branches on that 'merged' branch
web:
    modules: [web_responsive]
    src: https://github.com/OCA/web 12.0

backend_theme:
    modules: [backend_theme_v12]
    src: https://github.com/Openworx/backend_theme 12.0
```
{% endcode %}

## How to launch Odoo \(in case of server reboot\) ?

1. Connect to your server as `root`
2. Open your user session with `su - erp` \(if your user name is `erp` \)
3. \(re\)-open a  `byobu` session
4. Go to your Odoo project folder
5. Launch docky with `docky run`
6. Inside your docky container, launch Odoo with the same installation command you lastly used, for instance :

```bash
odoo -i base,crm,contacts,base_usability,partner_tree_default,remove_odoo_enterprise,web_responsive,disable_odoo_online,backend_theme_v12
```

    7. escape your `byobu` session without closing it using `F6` .
